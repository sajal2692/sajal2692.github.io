Had the privilege of delivering a guest lecture on Agentic Systems with LangGraph for the Generative AI & Entrepreneurship class (MGT 899) at Yale University on 11 February 2025!

We explored how graph-based AI workflows enable structured decision-making, automation, and advanced capabilities for AI-driven products. It was an incredible experience discussing the evolving AI landscape with such an engaged and thoughtful audience.

Slides from the talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRsoVf7bCC5JjbpIsGkr8xw9EcwUlmfulF1eoCBVCU-sG0bpQx_fnFA6OdiCD9BmPCXYnVIq1NmhlzZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
