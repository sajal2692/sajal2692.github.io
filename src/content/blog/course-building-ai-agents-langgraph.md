After months of hard work, I’m thrilled to announce my first-ever video course, _[Building AI Agents with LangGraph](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/building-ai-agents/0642572077884/)_, in partnership with O’Reilly! 🎉

This journey has been both challenging and deeply rewarding. I’ve taken countless online courses over the years—many of which have shaped my career in meaningful ways. Being on the other side, creating one myself, has been an incredible experience. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to think deeply about how to teach these concepts effectively and make them engaging.

At the core of it all, my mission has always been to create content that helps people learn, explore, and build in the rapidly evolving world of AI. Doing this with O’Reilly, a name that has been synonymous with high-quality learning for decades, is truly an honor.

### What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of AI agents: reasoning, action-taking, and the ReAct pattern
- How to implement agents from scratch using Python and OpenAI
- Designing and building multi-agent architectures with LangGraph
- Practical applications and workflows for AI-powered automation

This course is ideal for AI engineers, software developers, and data scientists looking to deepen their knowledge of agentic AI applications. It’s an intermediate-level course, so familiarity with Python and LLM frameworks like LangChain will help you get the most out of it.

### Why This Course Matters

AI agents are more than just chatbots—they are intelligent systems that can _reason_ and _act autonomously_, making them incredibly powerful for real-world applications. Whether you’re looking to integrate AI agents into your projects or transition into an AI engineering role, this course will give you the skills to build and deploy agentic applications effectively.

A shoutout to **Nicole Butterfield** and **Charlotte Ames** from O'Reilly for their incredible support throughout this journey!
