## 🌟 Professional Overview

I'm an AI Engineer and Technology Leader passionate about building cutting-edge Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing systems.

With over eight years of experience in product development and consulting across various industries, I've worked on AI-driven solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible. Currently, I’m part of **Menyala, a venture studio backed by Temasek** in Singapore, where I focus on developing AI-powered ventures designed to transform industries.

Here's a bit more about my professional milestones:

- **AI Engineer / Technologist at Menyala (Temasek-backed Venture Studio in Singapore)**: My role involves architecting AI-first products, developing scalable systems, shaping technology strategy with product and business teams, and consulting on AI strategy across Menyala’s ventures.
- **Lead AI Engineer at OneByZero**: Led a team of 6, building AI solutions across telecom, marketing, and enterprise ventures, including RAG systems, AI agents, and image generation for product marketing. Designed and deployed scalable AI architectures, advancing Generative AI applications in real-world use cases.
- **Senior AI Engineer at Splore, a Temasek-backed startup**: Enhanced AI-driven search by refining ranking algorithms and fine-tuning embedding models to improve relevance and user experience. My work combined Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with core NLP techniques to create a more intuitive and intelligent search system.
- **Journey at Unscrambl India, from Data Scientist to Senior Machine Learning Engineer**: Built and deployed pre-GPT chatbots using traditional NLP—serving tens of thousands of users daily across Southeast Asia. Played a key role in core product innovation by developing advanced NL2SQL systems, enabling seamless natural language interactions with databases and enhancing Business Intelligence capabilities.

## 🌱 Beyond the Workspace
