# Sajal Sharma's Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website. This site showcases my professional journey, skills, and projects in the fields of Machine Learning, NLP, and AI. 

## Overview

- **Purpose**: This repository hosts the static files for blog and portfolio, albeit the portfolio is lacking for now.
- **Technology**: The site is built with [Astro.js](https://astro.build/), leveraging the [AstroPaper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).

## About AstroPaper

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, and SEO-friendly blog theme for Astro.js, perfect for creating personal blogs. It's designed to be accessible and supports light and dark modes by default. The theme is self-documented, meaning the posts and articles within can serve as documentation. For more information on using and customizing AstroPaper, visit [AstroPaper on GitHub](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
